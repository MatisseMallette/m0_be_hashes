# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
>I didn't struggle, really, but I have a lot of questions regarding why things are done the way that they are. Why weren't the hash values within the array given names? Is that even possible?

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
>My notes mainly consist of vocabulary definitions and reminders. I find myself taking the most notes when I'm reading or listening to someone speak, as opposed to working on a problem.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
>I usually do both. I know I could probably "hack" my way through both of these problems, but I want to adhere to conventions, so I'll see how other people do things just to be safe.
